## FanHypnose
This is a new version of FanHypnose's website, which is an hypnotherapist.

### Why I'm developing a new website
There are several reasons why I'm building a new website for this company:

* The [old website](https://fanhypnose.fr) is based on WordPress + Elementor.
* Recently, it had a huge security issue caused by an extension. I then decided to move from WordPress because it's unoptimized and can have security issues easily.

## Stack
The new website will be built with Astro, TypeScript and Storyblok as a headless CMS. If needed, it will also use Svelte for components/reactivity purposes.
